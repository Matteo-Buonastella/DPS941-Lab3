a) What is mapping in autonomous robotics?

- Maps are a model for the environment needed by the autonomous robot. Mapping is the problem of integrating the information gathered with the robot's sensors into a given
  representation. 

b) How important is the map’s accuracy for the robot’s autonomous navigation task?

- An accurate map is very important for the robot's autonomous navigation task as it will use the map in order to determine the optimal course of action in order to get
from point A to point B. 

c) What are dynamic objects in autonomous robotics? Either explain or provide some examples.

- Dynamic objects are things/obstacles in the environment that doesn't have a set location and so the robot will have to know how to react if it encounters it. 
For example, if you have a an autonomous robot that is cleaning a house, it will need to interact and consider dynamic objects like a cat that moves right in front 
of it. The robot would need to detect this object and then move around it.

d) Should the dynamic objects be present when mapping an arena?

- Dynamic objects should not be present when mapping an arena as it will not have a specific location. Your robot should instead be equipped with the ability to react
in a specific way if it detects a dynamic object.
